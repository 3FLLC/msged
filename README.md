The FidoNet BBS message editor

This code is largely of historical interest, it's the source for the MsgEd message editor for FidoNet.
It was written to be portable between the main compilers of the day and is fairly portable C-90. It is
intended for MS-DOS, so it should work well under FreeDOS, if one is so inclined.
